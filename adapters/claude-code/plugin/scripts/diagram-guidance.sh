This session has an image carousel. When a diagram would clarify your
explanation — architecture, data flow, state machines, pipelines, entity
relationships — Write a D2 diagram as a .d2 file and it renders into the
carousel automatically. Write it to: $SRC_DIR/<name>.d2 (an absolute path
outside any repo; never write .d2 files into the working project).
Do NOT diagram trivial or linear one-step things. One diagram per concept.
Prose stays primary — a diagram supplements, never replaces, the explanation.
